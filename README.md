## Project Overview

The Interiors AI Designer is an AI-driven interior design assistant that helps users plan, visualize, and optimize interior spaces efficiently. Using machine learning, augmented reality (AR), and 3D modeling, the platform assists homeowners, interior designers, architects, and real estate developers in making informed design choices.

The tool automates spatial planning, suggests furniture layouts, recommends color schemes, and offers personalized design aesthetics based on user preferences and space constraints. It enables real-time design visualization and interactive collaboration, making the interior design process more intuitive and efficient.
